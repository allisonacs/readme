## Wut?

Readmes are the instruction manuals of the internet, and this is a readme for me. I hope it will help you more quickly understand who I am, how I work, and how I will help you. It‚Äôs also an exercise for me to better identify and refine my own thoughts and values. 

### This is‚Ä¶ 
 
- A work in progress 
- Just a primer
- Setting some expectations for working with me

### This is not‚Ä¶  

- Setting expectations for you  
- A replacement for spending time to actually get to know each other
- Set in stone

I am interested in continually iterating and fine-tuning this guide. Constructive feedback is always welcome. Call me out if you see discrepancies between this and IRL.

## A little about me

- I live in San Francisco with my wife, Amy, and our dog, Mac. You will hear me talk about them‚Ä¶ a lot.
- I like to rock climb, ride bikes, and cook. You‚Äôll hear me talk about these too‚Ä¶ a lot.
- I love Star Wars, Scully, Stevie Nicks, and Snoopy. Also shitty pop punk. 
- I swear. üò¨ So does our [CEO](https://www.recode.net/2014/12/17/11633872/zendesk-co-founder-mikkel-svane-writes-a-memoir). üò¨üò¨ 
- My favorite social network is Tumblr.
- I also take pictures of vanity license plates. Someday I‚Äôll make an instagram out of them.

## My job

My main responsibility is making sure you are happy and have everything you need to do your job. I‚Äôm here to empower you. Some ways I do that:

- Set context. You gotta know what you‚Äôre working on and why you‚Äôre working on it. You also need to know the expectations.
- Provide guidance. Early and often, in a way that is direct--but kind--and as close to the originating situation as possible.
- Clear the path and provide air cover for you. Gardeners have their attention pulled in a lot of different directions. I‚Äôll help you prioritize what matters to you.

I have some other responsibilities on Garden too. Briefly, those are:

- Consulting with, critiquing and training other teams on how to best utilize Garden
- Strategic planning and team growth
- Designing and documenting components

## What I value

With regards to [Garden](https://garden.zendesk.com), my personal values fall exactly in-line with our company values:

- Focus on relationships. The design system and all the tools and things we do to support it are meant to foster an atmosphere of warm, open collaboration. We rely on the input of our team because everything we make belongs to everyone else. Excellent relationships with our team pave the way for our success.
- Practice empathy. Not everyone has the same goals as you or me. Always always always strive to understand where someone is coming from before asserting an opinion or making a decision. 
- Be humblident. I hire people I believe in. Practice quiet confidence, always be learning, always be open to feedback, and you‚Äôll be just fine. 

For myself, I value:

- Autonomy
- Being proud of what I create
- Having fun at work
- Diversity, inclusivity, and equality
- Honesty and transparency
- Direct feedback and recognition

As such, I will try my best to make sure that you have those things as well. If you value something else, please let me know, and I‚Äôll try to make sure you have those things too.

## Some personality stuff if you‚Äôre into that üôÉ

Like everyone, I‚Äôm a study in contradictions. I‚Äôm definitely an introvert, but I am not shy. I do well at the extreme ends of group sizes: 1-5 people, so that I can have meaningful interactions, or huge groups where I am giving a presentation or workshop. I‚Äôve got a bit of social anxiety, so I get quiet in mid-size groups, and I‚Äôm awful at small talk and ‚Äúnetworking.‚Äù

I usually write about something to work it out in my mind. I think language matters, because I‚Äôve seen language cause real damage to people and projects. When we‚Äôre clear in our writing, we‚Äôre clear on our message. See also: this document. 

I have a very dry sense of humor, and I can be very sarcastic. At times, this has come off as mean or condescending. I never want people to feel that way, and I am working to make sure I don‚Äôt do that. Let me know right away if I mess this up. 

My top five strengths in Gallup Strengths Finder are shockingly accurate:

1. [Input](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/688/input.aspx)
2. [Strategic](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/718/strategic.aspx)
3. [Empathy](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/667/empathy.aspx)
4. [Intellection](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/691/intellection.aspx)
5. [Adaptability](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/628/adaptability.aspx)

And here are some personality test results. I don‚Äôt put much weight into any of these frameworks, but they‚Äôre fun and might give you some insights.

- I‚Äôm an INFP (‚Äúhealer‚Äù), and more specifically and INFP-T (‚Äúmediator‚Äù). 
- I‚Äôm a Pisces. 
- My personality number is 9, but‚Ä¶ 
- I‚Äôm an enneagram Type Two (‚ÄúThe Caring, Interpersonal Type‚Äù)--or is it Type Eight (‚ÄúThe Challenger‚Äù)? 

If any of this freaks you out, don‚Äôt worry. I also believe that, 

> ‚ÄúWhen it comes to adjusting to personalities, I strongly believe that the person in the more senior position is getting paid, partially, to adjust to the personality styles of the people reporting to them.‚Äù

## Guidance and coaching

Above all, I am here for you, and my goal is help you do and be the best. You are here because I already think you are awesome, and that you know what you‚Äôre doing. I will always believe in your positive intentions, and any guidance I give is always given with positive intentions.

I believe in [radical candor](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054668/former-googler-lets-us-in-on-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss), and I‚Äôve been trained in how to ‚ÄúBe direct without being an @$$hole‚Äù (seriously, that‚Äôs the name of the workshop). I will give you guidance based in the [SBI framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm). I‚Äôll also do it in a timely manner. If you‚Äôd like specific feedback on something, let me know!

I am a good listener, and I can take on whatever role you need from me. I try to understand all points of view. I can guide when it‚Äôs helpful, and get out of the way when it‚Äôs not.

I believe we need to feel safe with each other and our team, so that we all feel comfortable making mistakes regularly. Let‚Äôs make sure we laugh a lot together to ensure those things.

Finally, when I give you feedback, please consider it openly and  critique it thoughtfully. That‚Äôs the _only_ requirement. If something isn‚Äôt feedback, but rather a direction, I‚Äôll be clear about that. 

Also I love getting feedback. Please always feel free to give me direct feedback, early and often. 

### A note on 1:1s

1:1s are for you, and they‚Äôre about you. They are explicitly *not* about status updates (unless you want to update me on status).

In the beginning, we‚Äôll have weekly, 45 minute 1:1s. There‚Äôll be some rigid structure to them in the beginning, but they‚Äôll quickly evolve into whatever works best for you. Weekly? Biweekly? 30m? 60m? In office? Out for a walk? Your call.

We‚Äôll have a running 1:1 document for us to use for agenda and notes. I‚Äôll sometimes have topics to cover with you, and I might ask you to prepare something ahead of a 1:1. For the most part though, I expect that you‚Äôll determine the content our meetings.

I prefer to do one-on-ones in person if possible, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one and rescheduling is an option, please do so.

## Logistics

### My in-office time

I am usually in the office between 10am and 6pm. I‚Äôm often in earlier or later, but you can usually count on finding me here during these times. I occasionally work from home on Wednesdays. You‚Äôll know ahead of time if that‚Äôll be the case.

### If you need something

- You are always welcome and encouraged to drop a meeting on my calendar. My calendar is open, and events are almost always visible (there are rare exceptions to this).
- I occasionally put blocks on my calendar for ‚Äúfocus time.‚Äù You can schedule over these blocks.
- If you want or need to talk to me, and my schedule is **not** open, DM me on Slack or text me, and I‚Äôll make sure we talk _that day._
- You have edit access to every meeting I schedule with you, so if the timing doesn‚Äôt work for you, move it to a time that does. 
- If I‚Äôm at my desk, and I have my big headphones on, it *does not* necessarily mean I‚Äôm in the zone or expect not to be interrupted (I just like listening to music at work). Feel free to grab my attention (preferably by tapping my desk).
- I am good at telling people when I‚Äôm not able to give them time, and am always willing to find another time to help. Just ask, and I‚Äôll answer honestly üôÇ

### Evenings, weekends and PTO

When I leave the office, I really leave the office. I usually do not bring my work computer home, and I do not have notifications on for either Slack or email. Generally, I‚Äôll get back to you first thing the next working day. If you absolutely need to reach me when I‚Äôm not in the office, texting me is your best bet. 

I take PTO. I usually delete Slack and email from my phone while on PTO to avoid the temptation of a bored moment. If you need to reach me while I‚Äôm on PTO, make sure it can‚Äôt wait, and text me.

All this said, I do sometimes work very early or late, or over the weekends. This is not routine--it usually means I‚Äôm super into whatever project I‚Äôm on. _Outside of emergencies, you are never expected to do the same._ (Are there really design emergencies though?)

## Known bugs

I often joke that I have Opinions with a capital O. As I‚Äôve transitioned from IC to manager, I‚Äôve learned to curb them when appropriate. But, this is something I do slip up on, and it might feel like I‚Äôm directing you to follow my opinion (aka micromanaging). If I slip into this, call me out _immediately._

Delegation could probably use some work. We‚Äôve been a small, scrappy team for a long time, and I‚Äôve been responsible for the design side. If you want to try something that I‚Äôve been doing, just let me know. 

This document was written by me, and I have never been managed by me. Humans are notoriously bad about describing themselves; I‚Äôm no different. If you think something in here is wrong, just let me know and we‚Äôll work out something closer to reality.

I can be overly verbose when I write. I need to self-edit more. That‚Äôs true in this document.

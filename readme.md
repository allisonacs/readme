# Allison.readme

## Wut?

Readmes are the instruction manuals of the internet, and this is a readme for me. I hope it will help you more quickly understand who I am, my role, how I work, and how I will help you. It’s also an exercise for me to better identify and refine my own thoughts and values. This document is not about setting expectations for the people that work for or with me, or a replacement for actually getting to know each other. 

### Disclaimer

I’m a human, not a piece of software. “Updates” happen continually, and—unlike this readme—are not subject to PRs or release notes. Like all documentation, this readme has a tendency to fall behind the current release. 

## Quick start guide

- I live in San Francisco with my wife, Amy, our daughter, and our dog. You will hear me talk about them… a lot.
- I like to rock climb, ride bikes, bake sourdough, and cook. You’ll hear me talk about these too… a lot.
- I love Star Wars, Scully, Stevie Nicks, and Snoopy. Also shitty pop punk. 
- I swear. 😬 So does our [CEO](https://www.recode.net/2014/12/17/11633872/zendesk-co-founder-mikkel-svane-writes-a-memoir). 😬😬 
- My favorite social network is Tumblr and I am not sorry about it.
- I also take pictures of vanity license plates. Someday I’ll make an instagram. Or a blog. Or something. Or not.

## My job

As the Director of Design Systems at Zendesk, I sit on the senior leadership team and report directly to the VP of Product Design. I oversee the Garden team and lead the Product Design team’s efforts around standardization and quality-setting. I contribute to strategic planning, and advocate for standardization, consistency and accessibility across our entire company.

## What I value

When it comes to [working with others](https://garden.zendesk.com), my personal values fall exactly in-line with the Zendesk company values:

- Focus on relationships
- Practice empathy
- Be humblident

For myself, I value:

- Autonomy
- Being proud of what I create
- Having fun at work
- Diversity, inclusivity, and equality
- Honesty and transparency
- Direct feedback and recognition

## Who I am

I’m a designer to my core. I’m here to make an impact and leave things better than when I arrived. I’m an un-shy introvert, so I do well at the extreme ends of group sizes: 1–5 people, so that I can have meaningful interactions, or huge groups where I am giving a presentation or workshop. I’ve got a bit of social anxiety, so I get quiet in mid-size groups, and I’m awful at small talk and “networking.” I try to overcome my awkwardness with humor. 

I’m purpose-driven and idealistic. I see opportunities in almost every challenge. I make things that enable other people to do their jobs better. I care about this job, and I care about making software that is kind to people. Sometimes, I care too much. 

### Features / strengths

My top five strengths in Gallup Strengths Finder are shockingly accurate:

1. [Input](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/688/input.aspx)
2. [Strategic](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/718/strategic.aspx)
3. [Empathy](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/667/empathy.aspx)
4. [Intellection](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/691/intellection.aspx)
5. [Adaptability](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/628/adaptability.aspx)

I’m a hard worker, I have a lot of grit, and I hold myself to very high standards, but I’ve also come to understand the power of asking for help (and a well-timed joke). I go deep on the things I care about. I’m also good at dealing with ambiguity. I can make progress even with unanswered questions, and I’d rather make a decision that needs to be reversed down the line than wait.

### In development / growth areas

Hard work, grit, and high standards are all well and good, but sometimes I take them to the extreme. I have perfectionist tendencies, I’ve been known to take on more than I can do, and just because I know that I can ask for help, doesn’t mean that I actually remember (or allow myself) to actually do it.

I’m also focused on better storytelling and how to connect with new and different audiences.

### Known bugs / things I do that may annoy you

I often joke that I have Opinions with a capital O. As I’ve transitioned from IC to manager, I’ve learned to curb them when appropriate. Slip-ups here look like micromanagement.

I have a *very* dry sense of humor, and I'm sarcastic. At times, this has come off as mean or condescending. I really don’t want you to feel that way, but on the off chance that I do, please let me know. 

### Edge cases / what gains and loses my trust

Be kind. Be fair. Be inclusive. Do what you say you’re going to do, and be transparent. It’s ok to change tacks, and it’s ok to be wrong or mess up. It’s not ok to hide these things, and it’s not ok to double down on bad decisions.

### Some personality framework stuff if you’re into that 🙃

And here are some personality test results. I don’t put much weight into any of these frameworks, but they’re fun and might give you some insights.

- I’m an [INFP (“mediator”)](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality), and more specifically and [INFP-T (“turbulent”)](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-mediator-infp-a-vs-turbulent-mediator-infp-t). 
- I’m a [Pisces](https://blog.prepscholar.com/pisces-traits). 
- My numerology personality [number is 9](https://www.yourtarotlife.com/blog/numerology/all-about-personality-number/#personality_number_9), but… 
- I’m an enneagram Type Eight (“The Challenger”), and I'm sorry in advance. 

## Logistics / communication

I believe we need to feel safe with each other and our team, so that we all feel comfortable making mistakes regularly and publicly. Let’s make sure we laugh a lot together to ensure those things.

My communication style is straight forward and direct. I am a good listener, and I can take on whatever role you need from me. I try to understand all points of view. I can guide when it’s helpful, and get out of the way when it’s not.

I’m a visual and kinetic processor, meaning I learn by seeing things and reading about them—but to truly internalize them, I need to write it down. I also write when I need to work something out in my mind. I think language matters. I’ve seen language cause real damage to people and projects, but I've also seen the right words inspire, motivate, and create happiness. When we’re clear in our writing, we’re clear on our message. The downside is that I can be overly verbose. I need to self-edit more. See also: this document. 

### Logistics

My core working hours are 10am–5pm. I’m often online earlier or later, but I’ll generally be reachable during those times. I'm attempting to timebox my email and Slack time to one half hour in the morning and one half hour in the evening.  

I try to step away from my desk at least once a day. I used to go on walks, but now I just want to play with my baby. At Zendesk, we try to maintain meeting free Wednesdays and Friday afternoons. As a director, that’s not always possible for me, but I try to respect it as much as possible for my people.

#### Pandemic logistics

In my role, meetings come with the territory. Still, we all need time to focus, and focusing during the pandemic is harder than normal times. So, I am trying to set harder boundaries here and cut back on my Zoom time. My goal is to have 20 hours of meetings or less each week.

#### If you need something

- Slack me first. I’ll answer as soon as possible, usually by the end of the day. If you need something from me ASAP, switch text me instead (this should rarely be true). 
- You can always drop a meeting on my calendar, but be aware that I put blocks on my calendar for “focus time.” Try to avoid scheduling over these blocks, but do let me know if you need to meet and can't find a timeslot.

#### Evenings, weekends and PTO

When I’m done working, I’m done working. I do not have notifications on for either Slack or email. If you absolutely need to reach me when I’m not online, texting me is your best bet. 

I take PTO. When I’m off, I usually delete Slack and email to avoid the temptation of a bored moment. If you need to reach me while I’m out, make sure it can’t wait, and text me.

All this said, I do sometimes work very early or late, or over the weekends. This is not routine—it usually means I’m super into whatever project I’m on. _Outside of emergencies, you are never expected to do the same._ (Are there really design emergencies though?)

## Submit a bug

### How I give feedback

I believe in [radical candor](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054668/former-googler-lets-us-in-on-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss), and I’ve been trained in how to “Be direct without being an @$$hole” (seriously, that’s the name of the workshop). I will give you guidance based in the [SBI framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm). I’ll also do it in a timely manner. If you’d like specific feedback on something, let me know!

Above all, I am here for you, and my goal is help you do and be the best. You are here because you know what you’re doing and I already think you are awesome. When I give you feedback, please consider it with an open mind. That’s the _only_ requirement. If something isn’t feedback, but rather a direction, I’ll be clear about that. 

### How I receive feedback

I thrive on feedback. I want you to have what you need, so please always feel free to give me direct feedback, early and often.
